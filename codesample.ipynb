That is, they choose their timestep sizes so that no more than a single charging event takes place during each step in most cases. The exact time of the charging event is unknown (beyond the resolution of the step size chosen by the orbital integrator), and therefore allowing more than one charging event per step would enhance this inaccuracy because it would permit several charging events to occur simultaneously at the start of a (single larger) step. The charging timescale should determine the modelling timestep used in the numerical integration.\n",

    " The method of [Hsu et al.

In this work, a timestep-splitting approach is taken to *ensure* that no more than a single charging event occurs within a single (sub)step, by recursively splitting the step until that condition is fulfilled.  This novel stochastic charging method automates the process of simultaneously updating the equations of motion and charging equation, $\\frac{dq_d}{dt} = \\sum_{\\alpha} I_\\alpha$,  by utilising a binary tree traversal algorithm. \n",

Since only one or zero charging events are permitted per timestep, the step is split in half, and the order in which the two events occur over time is generated using a binomial distribution with a second random number, $R_\\textrm{B} \\sim U(0,1]$ in a similar fashion:\n",

The arrow of time means that the code must execute a pre-order tree traversal (a variant of depth first traversal), so that the nodes are visited in the correct order and the timestep is incremented from leftmost leaf node to rightmost leaf node. The code abstracts the binary tree away and uses a tree walker function to track the level of the node and randomly generate the children of the current node it is located at, thereby adding a *left branch* and *right branch* frame object to the top of the call stack; then when the leaf node is reached, each walker function call is returned and a frame object is popped off the call stack. \n",
