    "## Brief Rationale and background for the charging method\n",
    "A nanograin’s charge varies stochastically with time and therefore in each timestep the number of electrons/ions collected by the grain must be estimated. \n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of modelling the inter-arrival times of plasma particles using an exponential distribution, the Poisson distribution can be used to model the number of charged particles being collected by the grain in a given timestep. The type of particle is handled by the algorithm as described below, involving Poisson and binomial probability distributions and weighting the various currents appropriately.\n",

    "(1994)](https://doi.org/10.1109/27.279018) but reach a similar approach. Their method can be summarised as \n",
    "    - (i) Generate a random number to determine how many events occur during the timestep using a Poisson probability distribution\n",
    "    - (ii) Decide the type of charging events that occurs according to the relative strengths of the various currents.\n",
